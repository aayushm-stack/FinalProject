# FinalProject
MergeConflictGameDev2026

This project is a basic** single-player FPS game prototype **made in Unity within a limited time frame (≈44 hours).

Our main goals for this project is to demonstrate core FPS mechanics, create an immersive war-zone experience with realistic environments, weapon handling,  and interesting storyline to keep player attached through the missions.

Major Challanges Faced

 1) Hardware Limitations (Low-End Devices)

One of the major challenges in this project was developing the game on low-end devices. Due to limited system performance, game development became more difficult.
The system struggled to handle large maps, detailed textures, and multiple characters at the same time.
Lag and slow performance made testing and fixing errors time-consuming.
High-quality graphics features like advanced lighting and shadows could not be fully used.
Even with these limitations, the project was optimized as much as possible to achieve acceptable performance.

2) Map Design & Environment

Creating a believable battlefield environment presented several difficulties.
Achieving a realistic feel using terrain tools
Correct selection and blending of map textures
Designing trenches, uneven surfaces, and war-zone layouts
Performance optimization while maintaining visual quality

3) Enemy Movement

Enemy behavior was the most complex part of the project.
Gun Pointing Direction:
Aligning enemy weapons correctly toward the player during combat was difficult.
Animation Transitions:
Smooth transitions between idle, walk, attack, and death animations were challenging to implement.
Navigation Agent Issues:
Unity’s NavMesh Agent did not work correctly on the uneven battlefield terrain.
As a workaround, manual movement logic was attempted, but achieving natural enemy movement remained difficult.
